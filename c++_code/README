 computeSurprise calculates the Surprise of the partition of a network

 The program receives two input files:
  - networkFile: A network represented by a list of links (pairs of nodes)
                 Each line contains two nodes separated by a 'tab'
  - partitionFile: Describes a given partition of the network
                 Each line contains a node and the community to which it
                 is assigned, separated by a 'tab'.
                 (The partition identifier must be a number)
  
 ** Two toy examples of these files are included within this folder 
    (network.pairs and partition.part)

Compilation:
g++ -o computeSurprise computeSurprise.cpp Surprise.cpp

Usage:
./computeSurprise network_file partition_file
